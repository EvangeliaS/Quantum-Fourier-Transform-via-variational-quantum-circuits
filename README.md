Variational quantum circuits are quantum circuits which contain gates with adjustable pa-
rameters. Such circuits are already physically realizable in small scale and there is a wide
range of possible applications for these promising structures. In this thesis, I develop the
idea of tuning a variational quantum circuit to simulate the important for quantum com-
puting, operation of Quantum Fourier Transform. I use algebraic arguments, so called an
ansatz, for reducing the depth of the variational quantum circuit and use different classi-
cal algorithms to optimize the parameters. The results of this thesis concerning 3-qubit
circuits can be possibly extended to a higher number of qubits.
